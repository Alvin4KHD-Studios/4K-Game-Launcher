# 4K-Game-Launcher

a Game Launcher used for Beans: Source

it's recommanded to use this launcher if your game is massive and you're doing only little changes to it
the game launcher doesn't include a updater for the game launcher currently.

This game launcher is rather meant for Younger developers that don't have 100$ to publish their games on steam

.Net Framework 4.8 required

also i'm not a good C# developer either, i actually added the strings so you don't search for everything in the code
