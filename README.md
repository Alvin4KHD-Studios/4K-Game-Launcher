a Game Launcher used for Beans: Source

can be also commerically reused (you're better off with steam)

it's recommanded to use this launcher if your game is massive and you're doing only little changes to it
the game launcher doesn't include a updater for the game launcher currently.

This game launcher is rather meant for Younger developers that don't have 100$ to publish their games on steam

.NET Framework 4.8 required

also i'm not a good C# developer either, i actually added the strings so you don't search for anything in the code 

also i use .NET Because C++ (WinAPI) is too diffculty

also thanks to anyone that helped me even if i didn't ask for your code that is literally open source (especially the stackoverflow community
before you think "dude you stole 100% of the code"
wrong i combined it or smth, i'm not sure.
it's just a basic C# game launcher with a updater.
i don't even earn money with this.
